# Python Program for Factorial and Mathematical Calculations

## Task Overview

This repository contains two Python programs that perform mathematical calculations using functions and the `math` module.

### Task 1: Calculate Factorial Using a Function
This program defines a function that calculates the factorial of a given number, using a loop or recursion. The user is prompted to enter a number, and the factorial of the number is displayed.

### Task 2: Mathematical Calculations Using the `math` Module
This program asks the user to input a number and then calculates the following mathematical values:
1. **Square Root**: The square root of the number.
2. **Natural Logarithm (log base e)**: The natural logarithm of the number.
3. **Sine**: The sine of the number (in radians).

The program uses Python's built-in `math` module to perform these operations.

## Features
- **Task 1**: Factorial calculation using a function, supporting both loop and recursion approaches.
- **Task 2**: Utilizes the `math` module to calculate square root, natural logarithm, and sine of the entered number.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- The program uses Python's built-in `math` module (for Task 2).

## How to Run
