# Python File Handling Tasks

This repository contains two Python scripts that perform file handling tasks.

## Task 1: Read a File and Handle Errors

### Problem:
1. Open and read `sample.txt`.
2. Print its content line by line.
3. Handle `FileNotFoundError` if the file does not exist.

### How to Run:
1. Ensure that `sample.txt` exists in the same directory as `task1.py`.
2. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python task1.py
````

### Expected Output:

* Displays each line of the file with line numbers.
* Prints an error message if `sample.txt` is not found.

## Task 2: Write and Append Data to a File, Then Read It

### Problem:

1. Write user input to `output.txt`.
2. Append more text to the same file.
3. Read and display the final content of the file.

### How to Run:

1. Run the script:

   ```bash
   python task2.py
   ```

2. Enter text when prompted to write and append data.

### Expected Output:

* The script will display the final content of `output.txt` after both write and append operations.

---

### Key Changes:
1. **Task 1** uses `task1.py`.
2. **Task 2** uses `task2.py`.

### Next Steps:
1. Save this as `README.md`.
2. Ensure you have the two Python scripts:
   - `task1.py` for Task 1.
   - `task2.py` for Task 2.
